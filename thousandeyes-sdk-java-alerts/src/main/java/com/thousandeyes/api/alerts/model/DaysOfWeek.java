/*
 * Alerts API
 * You can manage the following alert functionalities on the ThousandEyes platform using the Alerts API:  * **Alerts**: Retrieve alert details. Alerts are assigned to tests through alert rules.  * **Alert Rules**: Conditions that you configure in order to highlight or be notified of events of interest in your ThousandEyes tests. When an alert ruleâ€™s conditions are met, the associated alert is triggered and the alert becomes active. It remains active until the alert is cleared. Alert rules are reusable across multiple tests..  * **Alert Suppression Windows**: Suppress alerts for tests during periods such as planned maintenance. Windows can be one-time events or recurring events to handle periodic occurrences such as monthly downtime for maintenance.  For more information about the alerts, see [Alerts](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/alerts).
